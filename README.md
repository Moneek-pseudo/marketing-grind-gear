# GrindGear - Marketing Website 💼🎒

This is a simple marketing website I built for a fictional gym bag brand called **GrindGear**. It was created as part of a project to practice web development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, **vanilla JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. I also added some scroll animations using the **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** library.

## 🧠 Project Brief

> **Goal:** Create a marketing site that highlights a new product, explains its features, includes a signup form, and a way to contact the company.

## ✅ Features & Pages

### 🏠 Homepage (`index.html`)

- Hero image with brand name and tagline
- Short product intro
- Cards that link to each gym bag’s **feature page**
- Call-to-action (CTA) linking to **contact page**

### 🧳 Feature Pages

- Each bag has its own page with more details:
  - `duffel.html` – Classic Duffel

  - `compact.html` – Compact Carry
- Each page includes:
  - Hero section with image
  - A list of features
  - A call-to-action that links to the **signup page**

### 📬 Contact Page (`contact.html`)

I'm a beginner web developer with around **4 months** of learning. This project helped me apply what I've learned so far and explore basic responsive design, animations, and page structure.

Thanks for checking it out! 😊
